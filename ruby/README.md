# pdx.rb Monthly Exercise (Ruby)

## Initializing the Exercise

To get things started, get ruby installed on your machine however you see fit.
Once ruby is installed, running `. bin/setup` will get you set up with bundler
and rspec.

After that you should be able to run tests via `bundle exec rspec` and you're
good to go!
